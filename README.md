# AngularApp

This is my very first application using Angular.

## The application

It's a simple Task Tracker, containing CRUD, as well as a pseudo json server.

## How to use

First off, you will need to start the server, where we say "npm run server"
After this, you will get some tasks, where you can create a task, delete a task, update the reminder status, and see your tasks.

## Routing

Routing was also implemented, where you can see the about page. Router-outlet was also used.
